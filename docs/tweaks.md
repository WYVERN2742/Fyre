# Tweaks

Minecraft is quite the misleading game.
Although the gameplay loop is quite simple, there are a ton of interactions by different mechanics.
Tweaks are edits to some mechanics, or entirely new mechanics.

Please keep in mind that this is mostly a note document rather than proper documentation covering added mechanics.
