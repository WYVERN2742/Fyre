# Tweaks and Ideas

Minecraft is quite the misleading game.
Although the gameplay loop is quite simple, there are a ton of interactions by different mechanics.
Tweaks are edits to some mechanics, or entirely new mechanics.

This document is mostly a note of mechanic ideas an tweak brainstorming, feedback or comments are encouraged!

## Confirmed / Implemented Mechanics

- [x] Chests on boats
	- Players can shift-click boats to store items, breaking the boat drops the items
- [x] Longer Days
	- Daytime is twice as long, as it often feels too short
- [x] Saddled horses have AI disabled
	- Prevents horses from wandering away and getting lost (or sometimes killing themselves)
- [x] Walking on grass has a chance to make paths
	- Shows common paths throughout places, quite effective when in small spaces
	- Also functions faster on horses, converting grass blocks into grasspaths
	- > üê≤ Decided to change grass paths into coarse dirt. It turned out better.
- [x] Mob on-hit Events
	- [x] Phantoms blind for 3 seconds
	- [x] Zombies slow for 5 seconds
	- [x] Enderman apply weakness for 10 seconds
- [x] Glass breaks when fallen onto
- [x] Rotten flesh in Composters
- [x] Death to invisible players hides their name from chat
- [x] Harvest crops with hoe
- [x] Leather boots do not destroy crops
- [ ] Dying to undead creates a zombie/skeleton at the player which has their inventory.
	- The mob uses the player's equipped armor and weapon
	- The mob drops the player's inventory
- [ ] Loot table changes
	- Smelted red sand -> Red Stained Glass

## Mechanic ideas

- Loot table changes
	- Fishing in swamps give slimeballs
- Uncrafting
	- Turn items into their components, might be a balance problem
- Tie leads to fenceposts
- Some way to move spawners?
	- May be changed if underground is overhauled
	- Mob grinding is risk-free to get xp, not good.
- Extended potion crafting
	- Current brewing has a large amount of limits. Combine potions?
- Perk System
	- Allows adding mechanics for everyone, but perks make some stronger?
	- Uncrafting for example, perk would increase amount of resources obtained
- Zombies hold pickaxes when y<50
- Tickle pandas with feathers
- New Moon Event (More mob spawning?)
- ~~Enchanting water bottles give bottle o' enchanting~~
	- Would require rewriting minecraft's enchanting code
- ~~Red screen on hit (Worldborder effect)~~
	- Requires messing around with https://wiki.vg/Protocol#World_Border
- ~~Stacking snow~~
	- Snow stacks and builds up
	- > üê≤ Just use <https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/snowiersnow.72213/> instead

## Land Protection

With regards to the points made in [üê≤ Aims and Thoughts](#%f0%9f%90%b2-aims-and-thoughts),
a small summery of a protection system has been created.

1. Protections are based on a block. This block will be at the centre of the
	claimed region.
2. Players can join the protection by right-clicking on the block.
	- Owners of the claimed region can manage allowed players by right-clicking
		the block, which opens a chestUI of player's heads.
	- Players can only be a part of one claim
	- A clam's power is defined by the amount of *active* players
3. The protected area is a square originating from the block, with power
	defining the radius.
4. Power changes smoothly, any changes to current or max power, take time to change.
	- If a player leaves the claim and the max power decreases, the claim area
		does not instantly decrease to the new max.
5. If a border collides with another border, that side will stop expanding.
6. A particle effect and Toast, will define the edges of a claim.
7. A claim is 256 blocks tall
	- > üê≤ Not personally sure about this, however, most people are used to it.
8. A decaying claim (shrinking) will decay previously claimed blocks. Effects include:
	- Cracking stone bricks
	- Forest Expanding
	- Vines Spawning
	- Farmland converts to coarse dirt
	- > üê≤ Any more ideas for making places look abandoned?

## üê≤ Aims and Thoughts

Fyre's general aim is to provide a different way of playing a decade-old game.
It aims to be more of the adventuring-style MMO rather than the general sandbox
Minecraft is. We also want to avoid the "just another custom server", and so the
main aim is to implement everything as in-game mechanics, rather than commands,
admin shops, teleport commands, etc.

So far the mechanics for this idea relies on using Traders to gate content.
Although this does add a progression system, this may cause some dislike as
content players are used to regularly using, is locked behind walls. Some effort
to alleviate this will be done by a total rebalance of armor and damage ratings,
but this may yet again cause some problems with power-creep, and long-term
players completely dwarfing any new player.

Some research into using Minecraft's unused Attributes system for different
equipment mechanics is a must. Perhaps look into different scaling for player
health? Everyone is used to starting with 10 hearts, perhaps start with the 5
and add more depending on their armor.

Another challenge with rebalancing, is the enemy's in the game. Mobs are common
but generally weak, and while increasing the danger level of mobs does provide
more of a challenge, it is very hard to balance rewardable gaming and prevent
annoyance.

Perhaps we can reduce mob spawn amounts? And still make them stronger.
This will result in rarer mobs, making avoidance easy for players, but
still provide a challenge for players who are looking for it.

As for Pvp, it will not be disabled and not regulated either, it might be
interesting to see how players band and group up. However, this should not be a
pvp-focused server.

Due to human nature, there will be players who explicitly seek to grief other
players some methods to counter this should be researched. Although the server
will hav staff moderation, the aim is to reduce this as much as possible;- more
relying on mechanics.

Currently we're not sure what to do for area protection;- we do not want player
to come back onto the server only to find out their entire base and work was
destroyed We also don't want entirely abandoned and protected areas, since the
wilderness should be wild.

Something similar to towns perhaps? But this can cause a lack of creativity
trying to force settlements into chunks or regions, and then this will cause
another issue of claimed land, and how to deal with it. Things needed to keep in
mind are:

- Chest and Item Protection
- Area claiming is messy, unused vertical space and not suitable for natural builds
	- Also applies to towns: they mix people together but plots are unnatural
- Faction power system moves the mechanics to favour pvp
- Don't want a player to lose everything while offline (or too far away online)
- Don't want a large amount abandoned man-made structures that are protected

From these points, perhaps have a "nature-reclamation" system? slowly spread
grass and trees into player areas that damage blocks (cobble-stone -> break,
wood rot, stone bricks crack, etc) Pretty good mechanics wise, solves the issue
with abandonment, but what about actual protection? Protection can be based on
the state of the base, but how on earth can we keep it performant?

Perhaps to solve the town issue, have player-created towns containing npcs?

More view points on this area is needed. Would require a system that is
"in-game" e.g use mechanics rather than chat. This is annoying, since a
protection system is much-needed by any server for online use, and dictates a
large amount of gameplay. Any ideas at all are welcome, even ones on why
already-discarded ideas should be used!

For the record, these are the available protection systems and the main sticking
points:

- Towns
	- Too large and focused on chat-gameplay, overly complex solution for the protection issue.
	- Claiming is chunk or region-based
	- Town can be abandoned or changed while offline
	- More of a hierarchical ownership, rather than group
- Factions
	- Too pvp-oriented, with power based on deaths and player kills
	- Claiming is chunk or region-based
	- Faction can get taken over while offline
	- More of a hierarchical ownership, rather than group
- Lockable chests (and doors)
	- Protects chests only, buildings can still get griefed
	- claims don't expire, resulting in inaccessible chests
	- Can be annoying to add everyone to chest claims
- Grief Prevention
	- Claiming is chunk or region-based
	- Claims don't expire, resulting in abandoned inaccessible places
