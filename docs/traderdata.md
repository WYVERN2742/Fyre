## Custom trades

Regarding custom trades; currently there is an issue in 1.14.x due to villager
interaction with workstations However, even in the newest snapshot this issue
still persists, which will probably not be fixed in the near future.

There is an alternative method by creating a plugin, since
<https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/inventory/Merchant.html>
works correctly and suits the needs of the plans. this will also guarantee
per-player progression in regards to trades

So in other words: a custom plugin will have to be created to solve this issue.
