# Progression & Mechanics

Fyre is a total overhaul of the vanilla game. Because of this a rebalance of Minecraft's progression system
is needed. This is done by datapacks and server plugins.

## Advancements

Advancements are viewed by the client in the Advancements menu (Default keybind: `L`)
They look similar to the example below:

![Advancement](img/Advancement-Example.png)

The `"frame"` option provides the outline shape of the advancement. There are three options.

| Type      | Preview                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Task      | ![Square Advancement](img/Frame-Task.png)       |
| Goal      | ![Rounded Advancement](img/Frame-Goal.png)      |
| Challenge | ![Starred Advancement](img/Frame-Challenge.png) |

> The current Fyre guideline is to only use Challenge achievements for branches that unlock
> other advancement trees. In addition, tasks should not normally be announced to the server
> chat, while Goal advancements should be harder to obtain but announced.

### Welcome to Fyre

Welcome to Fyre is the introductory tree for new players.
