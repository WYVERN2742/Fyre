## Custom trades

Regarding custom trades; currently there is an issue in 1.14.x due to villager interaction with workstations
However, even in the newist snapshop this issue still persists, which will probably not be fixed in the near future.

There is an alternative method by creating a plugin, since https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/inventory/Merchant.html works
correctly and suits the needs of the plans. this will also guarantee per-player progression in regards to trades

So in other words: a custom plugin will have to be created to solve this issue.
