# Fyre

Fyre is an ambitious overhaul for the sandbox game minecraft.
Unlike normal modpacks, Fyre aims to allow entirely vanilla clients, without any modding or changes made on the user's side.
As such, all the changes are done server-side, with the use of [datapacks](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack) introduced in Minecraft 1.13.x, and [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/)

Datapacks allow the changing of recipes, advancements, loot tables, and terrain structures to allow for an entirely new progression system within the game.
All of this is without the client needing to download any custom modifications, and are automatically applied anytime they join the server.

Along with the use of Datapacks, Fyre will also incorporate a custom server-side plugin, this will assist with Quality-of-Life such as teleporting players, chat formatting, etc.
While also implementing mechanics, such as trading with vendors for items and other features such as economy.
