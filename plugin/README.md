and `$ ./gradlew clean build` on *nix


## Staff Administration Features

Separate from implementing mechanics for Fyre, the plugin also has a few tools
to assist server operators and moderators. Currently planned and implemented are:

- [x] Detailed server status

- [x] See incoming connections
	![Picture of a console showing the ip address of a connecting player](../docs/img/Connecting-Console.png)
	<!-- TODO: Attach image of in-game player connecting -->
- [ ] Announce when a player changes IP addresses from previous entries
	- Includes total changes, and how long between each change
		> üê≤ We will not keep a history of all addresses, only one previous.
- [ ] Announce when a player joins from someone else's IP address
	- Easily see when a banned player is attempting to use an alt account
- [ ] Private message history is saved to separate log files
	- Easily verify if someone is harassing players in private messages
